# üå± Carbon Emission Predictor for Goods Vehicles

A machine learning model that predicts CO‚ÇÇ emissions of cargo/goods-carrying vehicles based on key parameters like engine size, fuel type, vehicle weight, and transmission.

---

## üöö What It Does

- Takes vehicle-specific data as input  
- Predicts estimated **CO‚ÇÇ emissions in grams/km**  
- Helps in assessing environmental impact and fuel efficiency

---

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Model training using regression algorithms  
- Exported trained model (`carbon_model.pkl`)  
- Prediction-ready pipeline

---

## Files Included

- `Carbon_Emission_Predictor.ipynb` ‚Äì Full project notebook  
- `carbon_model.pkl` ‚Äì Trained model (exported using pickle)  
- `vehicle_data.csv` ‚Äì Dataset (if included)  
- `README.md` ‚Äì Project description  
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äì Dependencies

## üìå Sample Prediction Code

```python
import pickle
import pandas as pd

# Load model
model = pickle.load(open('carbon_model.pkl', 'rb'))

# Sample input
data = {
    'EngineSize': 3.5,
    'FuelType': 'Diesel',
    'VehicleWeight': 2500,
    'Transmission': 'Manual'
}

df = pd.DataFrame([data])
prediction = model.predict(df)[0]
print(f"Estimated CO‚ÇÇ Emission: {round(prediction)} g/km")
```
