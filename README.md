# 🌱 Carbon Emission Predictor for Commercial Transport Vehicles

A machine learning model that predicts CO₂ emissions of cargo/goods-carrying vehicles based on key parameters like engine size, fuel type, vehicle weight, and transmission. The Model has an R² score of 0.90970 in predicting CO₂ emissions after cleaning and training on the dataset only for Freight, Cargo carrying commercial vehicles.

## 📌 Sample Prediction Code

```python
import pickle
import pandas as pd

# Load model
model = pickle.load(open('carbon_model.pkl', 'rb'))

# Sample input
data = {
    'EngineSize': 3.5,
    'FuelType': 'Diesel',
    'VehicleWeight': 2500,
    'Transmission': 'Manual'
}

df = pd.DataFrame([data])
prediction = model.predict(df)[0]
print(f"Estimated CO₂ Emission: {round(prediction)} g/km")
```
